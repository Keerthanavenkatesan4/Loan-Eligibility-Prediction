# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
In the project "Loan Eligibility Prediction using ML," I harnessed the power of machine learning to predict loan eligibility with remarkable success. Leveraging Kaggle data, the model achieved an outstanding accuracy score of 0.98 and an impressive F1 score of 0.99 when employing the Random Forest algorithm. This accomplishment underscores my proficiency in the field of machine learning, as I demonstrated expertise in advanced techniques such as cross-validation, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning. These methods were instrumental in optimizing the model's performance, ensuring that it provides highly accurate loan eligibility predictions. This project not only showcases my ability to work with real-world data but also my commitment to achieving exceptional results through data-driven techniques.
